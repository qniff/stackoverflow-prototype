Summary of this project

Most difficult thing is making comment to every answers and questions.
Questions and answers have specific id to acccess and we need to get the exact id to add comment.
So in database we need to access to the question id or answer id and get them into the comment table.

Major change is the tag table that user who want to question adds the tag for easy access the question.
But When we try to put tag it became complex. And we decided to not to make the tag table because it is not a necessary table and it can make the program heavy.

If we have to complete this project again, we will do some effort to UI. The window form doesn't look fancy. We can use GUI for better appearance of our program.
Also, we can choose more simple program from the beginning.
